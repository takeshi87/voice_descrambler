Quick prototype for analyser & descrambler of scambled voice samples as collected with HF radio.
Format details - time domain scrambling, by permutation of 44ms segments, in blocks of 15 segments.
Transmission has a preamble of CW signal around 2031Hz and FSK with offset 1200Hz, 200baud, centered around 1800Hz.
Postamble is FSK 1200Hz offset, ~22.8 baud, centered around 1800Hz.

Usage:

analyser.py - parser, analyses and tries to descramble files listed in 'files_to_use'. Permutation used is taken from 'testPermut' variable.

running it produces weights.txt, describing degree to which segments i, j are unsimilar (cost function). 
It can be further used to find the most optimal permutation of segments based on such cost function (and in current implementation - limiting permutations to 15 segment blocks - as seems to be done in the analysed mechanism).

Finding the permutation:

g++ puzzle_solver.cpp -o puzzle_solver -O3 -std=c++2a

./puzzle_solver < weights.txt
